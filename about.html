    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
      <p>👩‍💻Hi, I'm Jahanvi, a passionate web developer and a BTech Computer Science student. I thrive on creating intuitive, user-friendly websites and applications that solve real-world problems while blending creativity with functionality.🌟</p>
      <p>I’m currently pursuing my BTech in Computer Science, where I’ve gained a strong foundation in programming, web development, and software engineering. 
        💻My academic journey has equipped me with skills in front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and I’m also exploring back-end development with Node.js and Express.</p>
        <p>🌐Through my projects, I’ve built responsive websites, interactive applications, and innovative solutions. One of my favorite projects is a task management 🗂️app that helps users stay organized and productive.</p>
        <p>✨I’m fascinated by the intersection of technology and creativity. When I’m not coding, I enjoy writing articles✍️ on social issues like education, women empowerment, and environmental sustainability. Exploring SaaS trends and learning about emerging technologies also keep me inspired.
        🚀I aspire to work on innovative projects that make a positive impact on society. My dream is to contribute to building scalable, efficient, and accessible digital solutions.I’m a quick learner, a problem solver, and someone who enjoys collaborating with teams to achieve shared goals.</p>
        <p>💡"Code is like poetry; every line should be meaningful."✨This motto reflects my approach to programming and life, where I strive to create value in everything I do.🌟</p>
